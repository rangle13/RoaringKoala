    <h1>Roar Koala -- The Game</h1>
    The game is setup by a set of XML templates.  The templates contains a list
    of commands the user can select from.  Each command has a setup of actions
    based on the command.  The command also has parameters that can be entered
    by the user.  The parameters are contained in the in the templates,
    including any defaults or selections.  The command also contains the
    response that is expected from the command -- or at least that is my goal.
    Lets see how this works.
